=head2 Example 1

This very simple example shows how to create a basic command line tool.
The script would be called from the command line with a call with a URI to
collect the RSS file from and the file to transform the XML with, and
output going to STDOUT.

	#!/usr/bin/perl
	use strict;
	use XML::RSS::Tools;
	my $rss  = XML::RSS::Tools->new;
	if ($rss->rss_uri(shift) &&
	    $rss->xsl_file(shift) &&
	    $rss->transform) {
	    	print $rss->as_string
	    } else {
	    	print $rss->as_string('error')
	    };
