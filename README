XML/RSS/Tools version 0.15
==========================

RSS/RDF feeds are commonly available ways of distributing the latest news
about a given web site for news syndication. This module provides a VERY
high level way of manipulating them. You can easily use LWP, the XML::RSS
and XML::LibXSLT do to this yourself.

STATUS

This module is BETA code, it may have undocumented features "bugs", and
the API may change. It is currently under development and so now is the
time to add features to the code base before the API becomes fixed.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

It will install okay on Windows with ActiveState Perl without a compiler
just use the free Microsoft nmake tool instead of make.

During the install it will try to connect to the Internet to test the HTTP
toolchain.

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other non-core modules for full functionality:

  XML::LibXSLT XML::LibXML
  XML::RSS
  URI
  LWP or HTTP::GHTTP or HTTP::Lite

XML::RSS older versions than version 0.98 have a number of defects and
limitations, please upgrade if possible.

XML::LibXML and XML::LibXSLT rely on the GNOME libxml2 and libxslt libraries
which need to be installed before attempting to install the Perl modules.
XML Catalog support in certain versions of XML::LibXML appears to be broken
if you are unable to use Catalogs please let me know so that I can better
document the module.

Please be aware that the API to the URI module changed, at version 1.32,
and hence how you use the file scheme changed, see the URI changelog for
more details.

OLDER VERSIONS

To keep CPAN trim, older versions of this module will be continually culled as
newer versions are loaded. Older versions are archive on backPAN here:
http://history.perl.org/backpan/authors/id/A/AT/ATRICKETT/  and I keep copies
myself which are also available upon request.
